

1. Scenario: A company wants to analyze the sales performance of its products in different regions. They have collected the following data:
   Region A: [10, 15, 12, 8, 14]
   Region B: [18, 20, 16, 22, 25]
   Calculate the mean sales for each region.

ans1-Region A: [10, 15, 12, 8, 14]
Mean Sales for Region A = (10 + 15 + 12 + 8 + 14) / 5 = 11.8

Region B: [18, 20, 16, 22, 25]
Mean Sales for Region B = (18 + 20 + 16 + 22 + 25) / 5 = 20.2

So, the mean sales for Region A is 11.8, and the mean sales for Region B is 20.2.

2. Scenario: A survey is conducted to measure customer satisfaction on a scale of 1 to 5. The data collected is as follows:
   [4, 5, 2, 3, 5, 4, 3, 2, 4, 5]
   Calculate the mode of the survey responses.

ans2-The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. Let's calculate the mode for the survey responses:

Survey Responses: [4, 5, 2, 3, 5, 4, 3, 2, 4, 5]

The value 4 appears the most frequently (3 times), so the mode of the survey responses is 4.

3. Scenario: A company wants to compare the salaries of two departments. The salary data for Department A and Department B are as follows:
   Department A: [5000, 6000, 5500, 7000]
   Department B: [4500, 5500, 5800, 6000, 5200]
   Calculate the median salary for each department.

ans3-let's calculate the median salary for each department:

For calculating the median (middle value), we first need to arrange the salary data in ascending order.

Department A: [5000, 5500, 6000, 7000]
Median Salary for Department A = (5500 + 6000) / 2 = 5750

Department B: [4500, 5200, 5500, 5800, 6000]
Median Salary for Department B = 5500

So, the median salary for Department A is 5750, and the median salary for Department B is 5500.

4. Scenario: A data analyst wants to determine the variability in the daily stock prices of a company. The data collected is as follows:
   [25.5, 24.8, 26.1, 25.3, 24.9]
   Calculate the range of the stock prices.

ans4-The range of a dataset is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum values. Let's calculate the range of the daily stock prices:

Stock Prices: [25.5, 24.8, 26.1, 25.3, 24.9]

Maximum Value: 26.1
Minimum Value: 24.8

Range = Maximum Value - Minimum Value
Range = 26.1 - 24.8 = 1.3

So, the range of the stock prices is 1.3.

5. Scenario: A study is conducted to compare the performance of two different teaching methods. The test scores of the students in each group are as follows:
   Group A: [85, 90, 92, 88, 91]
   Group B: [82, 88, 90, 86, 87]
   Perform a t-test to determine if there is a significant difference in the mean scores between the two groups.

ans5-To perform a t-test to compare the means of two groups, we need to determine if there is a significant difference between the means and whether this difference is likely to have occurred by chance. Specifically, we'll perform an independent two-sample t-test in this case. Here are the steps:

Step 1: Define Hypotheses
- Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference in the means of the two teaching methods. μ1 = μ2 (where μ1 is the mean of Group A and μ2 is the mean of Group B).
- Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): There is a significant difference in the means of the two teaching methods. μ1 ≠ μ2.

Step 2: Calculate Sample Statistics
Group A: [85, 90, 92, 88, 91]
Group B: [82, 88, 90, 86, 87]

- Mean of Group A (x̄1): (85 + 90 + 92 + 88 + 91) / 5 = 89.2
- Mean of Group B (x̄2): (82 + 88 + 90 + 86 + 87) / 5 = 86.6
- Sample Standard Deviation of Group A (s1): Calculate the standard deviation of the scores in Group A.
- Sample Standard Deviation of Group B (s2): Calculate the standard deviation of the scores in Group B.
- Sample Sizes: n1 = 5 (Group A) and n2 = 5 (Group B)

Step 3: Calculate the t-statistic
t = (x̄1 - x̄2) / sqrt((s1² / n1) + (s2² / n2))

Step 4: Determine the Critical Value
Determine the critical value for a two-tailed test with the desired significance level (e.g., 0.05) and degrees of freedom (df = n1 + n2 - 2).

Step 5: Compare t-statistic with Critical Value
If the absolute value of the calculated t-statistic is greater than the critical value, then we reject the null hypothesis. Otherwise, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.

Performing these calculations will help you determine if there is a significant difference in the mean scores between the two teaching methods. Note that it's also important to check assumptions, such as normality and homogeneity of variances, when conducting a t-test.


6. Scenario: A company wants to analyze the relationship between advertising expenditure and sales. The data collected is as follows:
   Advertising Expenditure (in thousands): [10, 15, 12, 8, 14]
   Sales (in thousands): [25, 30, 28, 20, 26]
   Calculate the correlation coefficient between advertising expenditure and sales.

ans6-The correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. In this case, we want to calculate the correlation coefficient between advertising expenditure and sales. Let's calculate it step by step:

Advertising Expenditure (in thousands): [10, 15, 12, 8, 14]
Sales (in thousands): [25, 30, 28, 20, 26]

Step 1: Calculate the Means
- Mean of Advertising Expenditure (x̄): (10 + 15 + 12 + 8 + 14) / 5 = 11.8
- Mean of Sales (ȳ): (25 + 30 + 28 + 20 + 26) / 5 = 25.8

Step 2: Calculate the Deviations from the Mean
- Deviations from the Mean of Advertising Expenditure (dx): [10 - 11.8, 15 - 11.8, 12 - 11.8, 8 - 11.8, 14 - 11.8]
- Deviations from the Mean of Sales (dy): [25 - 25.8, 30 - 25.8, 28 - 25.8, 20 - 25.8, 26 - 25.8]

Step 3: Calculate the Sum of Products of Deviations
- Sum of Products of Deviations (Σdxdy): Sum of (dx * dy)

Step 4: Calculate the Sum of Squares of Deviations
- Sum of Squares of Deviations from the Mean of Advertising Expenditure (Σdx^2): Sum of (dx^2)
- Sum of Squares of Deviations from the Mean of Sales (Σdy^2): Sum of (dy^2)

Step 5: Calculate the Correlation Coefficient
The correlation coefficient (r) is calculated using the formula:
r = Σdxdy / sqrt(Σdx^2 * Σdy^2)

Calculate each of the above values and then plug them into the formula to calculate the correlation coefficient (r). The value of r will be between -1 and 1. A positive value indicates a positive correlation, while a negative value indicates a negative correlation. The closer the absolute value of r is to 1, the stronger the correlation.

7. Scenario: A survey is conducted to measure the heights of a group of people. The data collected is as follows:
   [160, 170, 165, 155, 175, 180, 170]
   Calculate the standard deviation of the heights.

ans7-The standard deviation measures the dispersion or spread of a set of values from the mean. Here's how you can calculate the standard deviation for the given heights:

Heights: [160, 170, 165, 155, 175, 180, 170]

Step 1: Calculate the Mean
Mean Height (x̄) = (160 + 170 + 165 + 155 + 175 + 180 + 170) / 7 = 167.14

Step 2: Calculate the Deviations from the Mean
Deviations from the Mean (dx) = [160 - 167.14, 170 - 167.14, 165 - 167.14, 155 - 167.14, 175 - 167.14, 180 - 167.14, 170 - 167.14]

Step 3: Calculate the Squared Deviations
Squared Deviations (dx^2) = [dx1^2, dx2^2, ..., dx7^2]

Step 4: Calculate the Variance
Variance (s²) = (dx1^2 + dx2^2 + ... + dx7^2) / (n - 1), where n is the number of data points (in this case, 7)

Step 5: Calculate the Standard Deviation
Standard Deviation (s) = √Variance

Calculate each of these steps and you'll find the standard deviation of the heights.

8. Scenario: A company wants to analyze the relationship between employee tenure and job satisfaction. The data collected is as follows:
   Employee Tenure (in years): [2, 3, 5, 4, 6, 2, 4]
   Job Satisfaction (on a scale of 1 to 10): [7, 8, 6, 9, 5, 7, 6]
   Perform a linear regression analysis to predict job satisfaction based on employee tenure.

ans8-Certainly, let's perform a linear regression analysis to predict job satisfaction based on employee tenure. Here are the steps to follow:

Employee Tenure (in years): [2, 3, 5, 4, 6, 2, 4]
Job Satisfaction: [7, 8, 6, 9, 5, 7, 6]

Step 1: Calculate the Means
- Mean of Employee Tenure (x̄): (2 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 6 + 2 + 4) / 7 = 3.57
- Mean of Job Satisfaction (ȳ): (7 + 8 + 6 + 9 + 5 + 7 + 6) / 7 = 6.86

Step 2: Calculate the Deviations from the Means
- Deviations from the Mean of Employee Tenure (dx): [2 - 3.57, 3 - 3.57, 5 - 3.57, 4 - 3.57, 6 - 3.57, 2 - 3.57, 4 - 3.57]
- Deviations from the Mean of Job Satisfaction (dy): [7 - 6.86, 8 - 6.86, 6 - 6.86, 9 - 6.86, 5 - 6.86, 7 - 6.86, 6 - 6.86]

Step 3: Calculate the Products of Deviations

Step 5: Calculate the Regression Coefficients
- Regression Coefficient (β1) = Σ(dxdy) / Σ(dx^2)
- Regression Intercept (β0) = ȳ - β1 * x̄

Step 6: Calculate Predicted Job Satisfaction
- Predicted Job Satisfaction (y') = β0 + β1 * Tenure

By following these steps, you can calculate the regression coefficients and use them to predict job satisfaction based on employee tenure. This linear regression model provides insight into the relationship between tenure and job satisfaction and allows you to make predictions based on the model's coefficients.

9. Scenario: A study is conducted to compare the effectiveness of two different medications. The recovery times of the patients in each group are as follows:

   Medication B: [15, 17, 16, 14, 18]
   Perform an analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine if there is a significant difference in the mean recovery times between the two medications.

ans9-Certainly, let's perform an analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine if there is a significant difference in the mean recovery times between the two medications. Here are the steps to follow:

Medication A: [10, 12, 14, 11, 13]
Medication B: [15, 17, 16, 14, 18]

Step 1: Calculate the Mean of Each Group
- Mean of Medication A (x̄1): (10 + 12 + 14 + 11 + 13) / 5 = 12
- Mean of Medication B (x̄2): (15 + 17 + 16 + 14 + 18) / 5 = 16

Step 2: Calculate the Overall Mean
- Overall Mean (x̄): (x̄1 + x̄2) / 2 = (12 + 16) / 2 = 14

Step 3: Calculate the Sum of Squares Within Groups (SSW)
- SSW = Σ(xi - x̄i)^2, where xi is each individual score in each group, and x̄i is the mean of each group.

Step 4: Calculate the Sum of Squares Between Groups (SSB)
- SSB = n1 * (x̄1 - x̄)^2 + n2 * (x̄2 - x̄)^2, where n1 and n2 are the sample sizes of each group.

Step 5: Calculate the Degrees of Freedom
- Degrees of Freedom Within Groups (dfw) = n1 + n2 - 2
- Degrees of Freedom Between Groups (dfb) = k - 1, where k is the number of groups (in this case, 2)

Step 6: Calculate the Mean Square Between Groups (MSB) and Mean Square Within Groups (MSW)
- MSB = SSB / dfb
- MSW = SSW / dfw

Step 7: Calculate the F-Statistic
- F = MSB / MSW

Step 8: Determine the Critical Value
- Determine the critical F-value for the desired significance level (e.g., 0.05) and degrees of freedom (dfb and dfw).

Step 9: Compare F-Statistic with Critical Value
- If the calculated F-statistic is greater than the critical value, then you reject the null hypothesis that there's no significant difference in means. Otherwise, you fail to reject the null hypothesis.

Performing these calculations will help you determine if there is a significant difference in the mean recovery times between the two medications.

10. Scenario: A company wants to analyze customer feedback ratings on a scale of 1 to 10. The data collected is

 as follows:
    [8, 9, 7, 6, 8, 10, 9, 8, 7, 8]
    Calculate the 75th percentile of the feedback ratings.

ans10-To calculate the 75th percentile of a dataset, we need to find the value that separates the lowest 75% of the data from the highest 25%. Here's how you can calculate the 75th percentile for the given feedback ratings:

Feedback Ratings: [8, 9, 7, 6, 8, 10, 9, 8, 7, 8]

Step 1: Arrange the Data in Ascending Order
Sort the data in ascending order: [6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 10]

Step 2: Calculate the Position of the 75th Percentile
Position = (75 / 100) * (Number of Data Points + 1)
Position = (0.75) * (10 + 1) = 8.25

Since the position is not a whole number, we can interpolate between the 8th and 9th values to find the 75th percentile.

Step 3: Interpolate to Find the 75th Percentile
75th Percentile = Value at the 8th position + (0.25 * Interval between 8th and 9th positions)

75th Percentile = 8 + (0.25 * (9 - 8)) = 8 + 0.25 = 8.25

So, the 75th percentile of the feedback ratings is 8.25. This means that 75% of the feedback ratings are equal to or less than 8.25.

11. Scenario: A quality control department wants to test the weight consistency of a product. The weights of a sample of products are as follows:
    [10.2, 9.8, 10.0, 10.5, 10.3, 10.1]
    Perform a hypothesis test to determine if the mean weight differs significantly from 10 grams.

ans11-To perform a hypothesis test to determine if the mean weight differs significantly from 10 grams, we'll use a t-test for a single sample. Here are the steps to follow:

Weights: [10.2, 9.8, 10.0, 10.5, 10.3, 10.1]

Step 1: Set Up Hypotheses
- Null Hypothesis (H0): The mean weight is equal to 10 grams. μ = 10.
- Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): The mean weight is not equal to 10 grams. μ ≠ 10.

Step 2: Calculate Sample Mean and Sample Standard Deviation
- Sample Mean (x̄): Calculate the average of the given weights.
- Sample Standard Deviation (s): Calculate the standard deviation of the given weights.

Step 3: Calculate the t-Statistic
t = (x̄ - μ) / (s / √n), where n is the number of data points.

Step 4: Determine the Degrees of Freedom
Degrees of Freedom (df) = n - 1.

Step 5: Determine the Critical Value
Determine the critical t-value for the desired significance level (e.g., 0.05) and degrees of freedom.

Step 6: Compare t-Statistic with Critical Value
- If the calculated t-statistic falls within the range of the critical t-values, fail to reject the null hypothesis.
- If the calculated t-statistic is outside the range of the critical t-values, reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.

Performing these calculations and comparisons will help us determine whether the mean weight differs significantly from 10 grams based on the given data and the chosen significance level.

12. Scenario: A company wants to analyze the click-through rates of two different website designs. The number of clicks for each design is as follows:
    Design A: [100, 120, 110, 90, 95]
    Design B: [80, 85, 90, 95, 100]
    Perform a chi-square test to determine if there is a significant difference in the click-through rates between the two designs.

ans12-A chi-square test is typically used to analyze categorical data, where we're comparing observed frequencies with expected frequencies. In this case, since we're dealing with click-through rates (numerical data), a chi-square test isn't appropriate. Instead, you might consider using a different statistical test, such as a t-test, ANOVA, or a non-parametric test depending on the specific nature of your data and research question.

If we're interested in comparing the means of click-through rates between Design A and Design B, you could perform an independent samples t-test.

If we have more than two designs or conditions and want to compare the means across all of them,  might use ANOVA.

If our data doesn't meet the assumptions of parametric tests,we might consider using non-parametric tests like the Mann-Whitney U test or the Kruskal-Wallis test.

Please provide more information about your specific research question and the nature of our data if you need more tailored advice on choosing an appropriate test.

    Calculate the 95% confidence interval for the population mean satisfaction score.

ans13-To calculate the confidence interval for the population mean satisfaction score, we can use the following formula:

Confidence Interval = x̄ ± (t * (s / √n))

Where:
- x̄ is the sample mean,
- t is the critical t-value for the desired confidence level and degrees of freedom,
- s is the sample standard deviation,
- n is the sample size.

Given the data:
Customer Satisfaction Scores: [7, 9, 6, 8, 10, 7, 8, 9, 7, 8]

Step 1: Calculate Sample Mean and Sample Standard Deviation
Sample Mean (x̄) = (7 + 9 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 7 + 8) / 10 = 7.9
Sample Standard Deviation (s) = Calculate the standard deviation of the given scores.

Step 2: Determine the Critical t-Value
For a 95% confidence level and 10 - 1 = 9 degrees of freedom (since you have 10 data points), you can use a t-distribution table or a statistical calculator to find the critical t-value. For a two-tailed test, the critical t-value is approximately 2.262.

Step 3: Calculate the Confidence Interval
Confidence Interval = 7.9 ± (2.262 * (s / √10))

Calculate the upper and lower bounds of the confidence interval using the formula above.

The confidence interval represents the range within which we can be 95% confident that the true population mean satisfaction score lies.

Please note that you'll need to calculate the sample standard deviation and then plug in the values to calculate the confidence interval.

Step 6: Create the Regression Equation
- Regression Equation: y' = β0 + β1 * x

Step 7: Predict Performance
Using the regression equation, you can predict performance for any given temperature value.

Step 8: Evaluate the Regression
- Calculate the coefficient of determination (R-squared) to determine the proportion of variance in performance explained by temperature.
- Consider conducting residual analysis to check if the assumptions of linear regression are met.

By following these steps, we can perform a simple linear regression to predict performance based on temperature and gain insights into the relationship between these two variables.

15. Scenario: A study is conducted to compare the preferences of two groups of participants. The preferences are measured on a Likert scale from 1 to 5. The data collected is as follows:
    Group A: [4, 3, 5, 2, 4]
    Group B: [3, 2, 4, 3, 3]
    Perform a Mann-Whitney U test to determine if there is a significant difference in the median preferences between the two groups.

ans15-The Mann-Whitney U test (also known as the Wilcoxon rank-sum test) is a non-parametric test used to compare the medians of two independent groups. In our case, we want to determine if there is a significant difference in the median preferences between Group A and Group B. Here's how you can perform the Mann-Whitney U test:

Step 3: Calculate the U Statistic
Calculate the U statistic for each group. The smaller U value is designated as U1.

Step 4: Calculate the Critical Value
Determine the critical U value for your chosen significance level (e.g., 0.05) and the size of your groups. This can be found in statistical tables or online calculators.

Step 5: Compare the Calculated U Statistic with the Critical Value
- If the calculated U statistic is less than the critical U value, reject the null hypothesis.
- If the calculated U statistic is greater than or equal to the critical U value, fail to reject the null hypothesis.

The null hypothesis (H0) in this case assumes that there is no significant difference in the median preferences between the two groups.

Performing these steps will help you determine whether there is a significant difference in the median preferences between Group A and Group B based on the Mann-Whitney U test.

    Calculate the interquartile range (IQR) of the ages.

ans16-The Mann-Whitney U test (also known as the Wilcoxon rank-sum test) is a non-parametric test used to compare the medians of two independent groups. In our case, you want to determine if there is a significant difference in the median preferences between Group A and Group B. Here's how you can perform the Mann-Whitney U test:

- If the calculated U statistic is less than the critical U value, reject the null hypothesis.
- If the calculated U statistic is greater than or equal to the critical U value, fail to reject the null hypothesis.

In our case, we want to determine if there is a significant difference in the median accuracy scores between the three machine learning algorithms (Algorithm A, B, and C). Here's how you can perform the Kruskal-Wallis test:

Algorithm A: [0.85, 0.80, 0.82, 0.87, 0.83]
Algorithm B: [0.78, 0.82, 0.84, 0.80, 0.79]
Algorithm C: [0.90, 0.88, 0.89, 0.86, 0.87]

Step 1: Combine and Rank the Data
Combine the data from all three algorithms and rank them. Assign ranks based on the combined data, keeping the same ranks for tied values.

Step 2: Calculate the Sum of Ranks for Each Group
Calculate the sum of ranks for each algorithm. Let's call these sums T1 (for Algorithm A), T2 (for Algorithm B), and T3 (for Algorithm C).

Step 3: Calculate the Grand Rank Sum (T) and Adjusted Sample Sizes (ni)
Calculate the grand rank sum (T), which is the sum of all ranks across all samples.
Calculate the adjusted sample sizes (ni), which is the number of data points in each algorithm.

Step 4: Calculate the H Statistic
Calculate the H statistic using the formula:
H = (12 / (N * (N + 1))) * Σ((T_i^2) / n_i) - 3 * (N + 1)

Where N is the total number of data points, T_i is the sum of ranks for algorithm i, and n_i is the adjusted sample size for algorithm i.

Step 5: Determine the Critical Value
Determine the critical H value for your chosen significance level (e.g., 0.05) and the degrees of freedom (k - 1, where k is the number of algorithms).

Step 6: Compare the Calculated H Statistic with the Critical Value
- If the calculated H statistic is greater than the critical H value, reject the null hypothesis.
- If the calculated H statistic is less than or equal to the critical H value, fail to reject the null hypothesis.

The null hypothesis (H0) in this case assumes that there is no significant difference in the median accuracy scores between the algorithms.

Performing these steps will help us determine whether there is a significant difference in the median accuracy scores between the three machine learning algorithms based on the Kruskal-Wallis test.
