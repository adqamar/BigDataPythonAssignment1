Let's go through each of the questions:

**Divisibility:**

1) To check if a number is divisible by 99, it should be divisible by both 9 and 11. Option (c) 913464 is divisible by 9 and 11, so it is divisible by 99.

2) The remainder when (2n + 2)^2 is divided by 4 can be found by simplifying the expression first: (2n + 2)^2 = 4(n + 1)^2. Since (n + 1)^2 is always a perfect square, it is divisible by 4. Therefore, the remainder is 0.

3) To find two nearest numbers to 19506 divisible by 9, we can perform the division: 19506 รท 9 = 2167 with a remainder of 3. The two nearest numbers divisible by 9 are 2167 * 9 = 19503 and 2167 * 9 + 9 = 19512.

9) To find the next larger integer divisible by 3, 5, and 12, you need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers. LCM(3, 5, 12) = 60. So, the next larger integer divisible by all these numbers is n + 60.

5) To find the unit digit of (316)^3n + 1, focus on the unit digit of 316 raised to a power. The unit digit of 316 is 6, and 6^3n will always have a unit digit of 6. Adding 1 to it doesn't change the unit digit, so the unit digit is 6.

6) To find the unit digit in (795 - 358), subtract the unit digits: 5 - 8 = -3. The unit digit is 3.

7) To find the rightmost non-zero digit in 302720, look at the unit's place, which is 0. Continue to the right until you find a non-zero digit, which is 2. So, the rightmost non-zero digit is 2.

8) To find the last digit of the product of these numbers, you can simply multiply their last digits: 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 6 x 7 x 8 x 9 = 72576. So, the last digit is 6.

9) To find the last three digits of the product, multiply 12345 by 54321 and then take the last three digits of the result.
