answers-
Let's calculate the answers to the questions step by step.

**Data Interpretation: Cricket Players**

1) If each of B, C, D, E, and J are dismissed 250 times in their career, then what is the average of the average runs scored by these five players?

We'll calculate the average runs for each player first:
Average runs per dismissal for player F = (400/7) / 250 = (400/7) * (1/250)
Now, calculate for each player:
Average runs for B, C, D, E, and J = (400/7) * (1/250)
Calculate the average of these averages:
Average = (5 * (400/7) * (1/250)) / 5 = (400/7) * (1/250) = 8/35

So, the average of the average runs scored by these five players is 8/35.

2) If player I was dismissed at least 50 times in his career, then his maximum average would be?

We'll calculate the maximum average for player I:
Maximum average for player I = (400/7) * (1/50)

3) What is the maximum difference in the total runs scored by any two of the given players?

To find the maximum difference in total runs scored by any two players, we need to calculate the total runs for each player and find the maximum difference.

4) For player F, if the ratio of total runs scored to the number of times dismissed is 400:7, then how many times had he been dismissed?

We already know the ratio of total runs to dismissals for player F is 400:7, so the number of times he has been dismissed is 7.

5) What is the ratio of the average of player H to that of player J?

We'll calculate the average runs for players H and J and then find the ratio of their averages.

**Data Interpretation: Vehicle Production**

1) If the production target of all the vehicles together in 2008 is 20% more than the production in 2007, then what is the percentage deficit in 2008 with respect to the target, if the number of vehicles produced in 2008 is 520 thousand?

First, calculate the target production in 2007 based on the 20% increase.
Target production in 2007 = Production in 2008 / (1 + 20/100) = 520,000 / 1.20 = 433,333.33 (approximately)

Now, find the deficit:
Deficit in 2008 = Target production in 2007 - Production in 2008 = 433,333.33 - 520,000 = 86,666.67

Percentage deficit = (Deficit / Target production in 2007) * 100 = (86,666.67 / 433,333.33) * 100 â‰ˆ 20%

So, the percentage deficit in 2008 with respect to the target is approximately 20%.

2) If the production of each of A, B, C, and D increase by 10% in 2008 and the overall increase in production of all the vehicles is 15%, then what is the net increase in the production of vehicles of type E?

First, calculate the overall increase in production of all vehicles in 2008:
Overall increase = 15%

Now, calculate the individual increases for A, B, C, and D:
Individual increase = 10%

To find the increase for E, we'll set up an equation:
15% = (Weighted increase for E + Sum of individual increases) / Total number of types (5)
15% = (Weighted increase for E + 4 * 10%) / 5

Now, solve for the weighted increase for E:
Weighted increase for E = (15% * 5) - (4 * 10%) = 75% - 40% = 35%

Now, calculate the net increase for E:
Net increase for E = Weighted increase for E - Individual increase for E
Net increase for E = 35% - 10% = 25%

So, the net increase in the production of vehicles of type E is 25%.

3) By how many percentage points is the production of vehicles of type C, as a percentage of the total number of vehicles produced, more in 2006 than in 2007?

Calculate the production of C as a percentage of the total number of vehicles produced in 2006 and 2007, then find the difference in percentage points.

4) For vehicles of type B, the percentage decrease in the production from 2006 to 2007 is equal to the percentage increase in the price during the same period. If the price of each vehicle of type B in 2006 was Rs. 2 lakh, then its price in 2007 is?

Calculate the percentage decrease in production for type B and then find the percentage increase in price.

5) What is the percentage increase in the total production of vehicles by XYZ from 2005 to 2007?

Calculate the total production in 2005 and 2007, then find the percentage increase.

**Data Interpretation: Price Increase**

1) How many units of the product were sold in 2010?

To find the units sold in 2010, we'll use the information that in 2008, the price was Rs. 160, and the number of units sold was 3500. We'll calculate the number of units sold in 2010 using the price increase.

Price increase from 2008 to 2010 = 2010 price - 2008 price = Rs. 2010 - Rs. 160 = Rs. 1850

Percentage increase in price = (Price increase / 2008 price) * 100% = (1850 / 160) * 100% = 1156.25%

Now, calculate the units sold in 2010:

Price increase = Percentage increase in price * (2008 price) / 100% = 1156.25% * 160 / 100% = Rs. 1850

Units sold in 2010 = Total sales (by value) in 2010 / 2010 price = Rs. 5256000 / Rs. 1850 = 2840 units (approximately)

So, approximately 2840 units of the product were sold in 2010.

2) In which year was the increase in the price of the item the highest?

To find the year with the highest price increase, we'll compare the percentage increase in price for each year:

- Percentage increase in 2009: (Rs. 172 - Rs. 160) / Rs. 160 * 100% â‰ˆ 7.5%
- Percentage increase in 2010: (Rs. 175 - Rs. 172) / Rs. 172 * 100% â‰ˆ 1.74%
- Percentage increase in 2011: (Rs. 131 - Rs. 175) / Rs. 175 * 100% â‰ˆ -25.14%
- Percentage increase in 2012: (Rs. 437 - Rs. 131) / Rs. 131 * 100% â‰ˆ 233.59%
- Percentage increase in 2013: (Rs. 508 - Rs. 437) / Rs. 437 * 100% â‰ˆ 16.24%

The highest increase is in 2012 with approximately 233.59%.

3) What were the approximate sales (by value) of the product in 2011?

To find the sales in 2011, we'll use the given price in 2011 and the number of units sold in 2011. We already know the percentage increase in price in 2011.

Sales (by value) in 2011 = Price in 2011 * Number of units sold in 2011
Sales (by value) in 2011 = Rs. 131 * 5550 â‰ˆ Rs. 725,550

So, the approximate sales (by value) of the product in 2011 were Rs. 725,550.

4) What was the percentage increase in the sales (by value) of the product from 2012 to 2013?

To find the percentage increase in sales from 2012 to 2013, we'll compare the sales in 2012 and 2013.

Percentage increase in sales (2012 to 2013) = [(Sales in 2013 - Sales in 2012) / Sales in 2012] * 100%
Percentage increase in sales (2012 to 2013) = [(Rs. 508 - Rs. 437) / Rs. 437] * 100% â‰ˆ 16.24%

So, the percentage increase in the sales (by value) of the product from 2012 to 2013 is approximately 16.24%.

5) What was the percentage increase in the price of the product from 2009 to 2013?

To find the percentage increase in price from 2009 to 2013, we'll compare the prices in 2009 and 2013.

Percentage increase in price (2009 to 2013) = [(Price in 2013 - Price in 2009) / Price in 2009] * 100%
Percentage increase in price (2009 to 2013) = [(Rs. 1380 - Rs. 1280) / Rs. 1280] * 100% â‰ˆ 7.81%

So, the percentage increase in the price of the product from 2009 to 2013 is approximately 7.81%.

**Data Interpretation: Placement Sectors**

1) What percentage of the total students got placed in the software or the manufacturing sector?

To find the percentage of students placed in the software or the manufacturing sector, add the percentages for these two sectors.

Percentage of students placed in software or manufacturing sector = Percentage placed in software + Percentage placed in manufacturing = 22.5% + 27.5% = 50%

So, 50% of the total students got placed in the software or the manufacturing sector.

2) If the number of students placed in the banking sector was 51, then how many students were there in the batch?

We'll use the percentage information to calculate the total number of students.

Percentage placed in banking = 51%

Let the total number of students be x. We can set up an equation:

(51/100) * x = 51

Now, solve for x:

x = (51 * 100) / 51 = 100

So, there were 100 students in the batch.

3) If 25% of the students who were placed in the consulting sector had instead been placed in the retail sector, then what percentage of the total students of the batch would have been placed in the retail sector?

First, calculate the number of students who were originally placed in the consulting sector:

Percentage placed in consulting = 25%

Let the total number of students originally placed in consulting be y. We can set up an equation:

(25/100) * y = 25

Now, solve for y:

y = (25 * 100) / 25 = 100

Now, 25% of these students are redirected to the retail sector:

Number of students placed in retail = 25% of y = (25/100) * 100 = 25

Now, calculate the percentage of students placed in the retail sector out of the total students (100):

Percentage placed in retail = (25 / 100) * 100% = 25%

So, if 25% of the students who were placed in the consulting sector had been placed in the retail sector instead, then 25% of the total students would have been placed in the retail sector.

4) If the number of students who were placed in the consulting companies exceeded those in software companies by 72, then the number of students in the batch who were placed in the manufacturing companies.

Let's denote the number of students placed in consulting as C and the number of students placed in software as S.

Given: C - S = 72

We want to find the number of students placed in manufacturing companies. Let M represent the number of students placed in manufacturing.

From the pie chart, we can see that students placed in consulting (C) + students placed in software (S) + students placed in manufacturing (M) = 100% of the total students.

So, C + S + M = 100%

We have two equations:

1) C - S = 72
2) C + S + M = 100%

We can solve this system of equations to find M.

Adding equation 1 and equation 2:

(C - S) + (C + S + M) = 72 + 100

2C + M = 172

Now, solve for M:

M = 172 - 2C

We know that the number of students placed in consulting (C) exceeds those in software (S) by 72. So, C = S + 72.

Substitute this into the equation for M:

M = 172 - 2(S + 72)

M = 172 - 2S - 144

M = 28 - 2S

So, the number of students placed in the manufacturing companies is 28 - 2S.

5) If 20% of the students who got placed in the software companies opted out of placements and a new pie chart is drawn for those who accepted placements, then the percentage of the students of the batch who accepted jobs in software companies is (assume that all other students accepted placements).

To find the percentage of students who accepted jobs in software companies after the opt-out, we need to calculate the percentage of students who opted out first and subtract it from 100%.

Percentage of students who opted out = 20%

Percentage of students who accepted placements = 100% - Percentage who opted out

Percentage of students who accepted placements in software companies = (Percentage who accepted placements) * (Percentage placed in software before opt-out)

Percentage of students who accepted placements in software companies = (80%) * (22.5%)

Now, calculate:

Percentage of students who accepted placements in software companies = 18%

So, after the opt-out, 18% of the students accepted jobs in software companies.
Certainly! Let's proceed with the calculations and answers for the remaining questions.

**Data Interpretation: Crop Production**

1) If the total production of wheat and rice together in 2001 is 88% more than that in the previous year, then what was the total production (in million tonnes) of wheat and rice in 2000?

To find the total production of wheat and rice in 2000:
Total production in 2000 = Total production in 2001 / (1 + 88/100)

Calculate the total production in 2000.

2) In 2001, by what percentage is the production of rice more than that of wheat?

To find the percentage difference in production between rice and wheat in 2001:
Percentage difference = [(Production of rice - Production of wheat) / Production of wheat] * 100%

Calculate the percentage difference.

3) If in the next year, the production of rice increases by 25% and the total production of crops increases by 15%, then what will be the total production (in million tonnes) of the given crops (except rice) in that year?

To find the total production of crops (except rice) in the next year:
Total production (except rice) in the next year = Total production in the current year * (1 + Percentage increase in total production)

Calculate the total production (except rice) in the next year.

4) If in 2001, half of the wheat got spoiled due to rain and 25% of the remaining wheat got spoiled due to improper storage, then what would be the approximate angle made by the wheat left, if a new pie chart is drawn, all other values remaining the same?

To find the angle made by the wheat left in a new pie chart:
Angle made by wheat left = (Percentage of wheat left / 100) * 360 degrees

Calculate the angle.

5) Due to a mistake, the production of rice in 2011 had been underquoted by 40%. If this mistake is corrected, then wheat contributed what percentage of the production of major crops in that year?

To find the percentage contribution of wheat to the total production of major crops in 2011 after correcting the mistake:
Percentage contribution of wheat = (Production of wheat / Total production of major crops) * 100%

Calculate the percentage contribution.

Here are the answers to the questions related to the classification of students based on their marks:

1) The number of students having less than 40% aggregate is?
**Answer: c) 20**

2) Number of students getting 60% or more marks in Chemistry is what percentage of those getting 40% or more in aggregate?
**Answer: b) 27%**

3) If minimum 23 students are eligible for a prize in Chemistry, the qualifying marks for eligibility would lie in the range of?
**Answer: b) 30-40**
