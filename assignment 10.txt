1. How do word embeddings capture semantic meaning in text preprocessing?
ans-Word embeddings are dense vector representations that capture semantic relationships between words. In text preprocessing, word embeddings map words to numerical vectors in a continuous space based on their context. Words with similar meanings are represented closer to each other in this space, allowing models to capture semantic nuances and relationships during downstream tasks like sentiment analysis or text classification.
2. Explain the concept of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their role in text processing tasks.
ans-RNNs are a type of neural network designed to handle sequential data like text. They process input sequentially while maintaining an internal hidden state that captures context from previous time steps. This allows RNNs to capture dependencies between words in sequences, making them suitable for tasks like language modeling, machine translation, and sentiment analysis.
3. What is the encoder-decoder concept, and how is it applied in tasks like machine translation or text summarization?
ans-The encoder-decoder concept is used for sequence-to-sequence tasks like machine translation or text summarization. The encoder encodes the input sequence into a fixed-length context vector, capturing its meaning. The decoder then generates the output sequence, step by step, using the context vector and its own hidden state. This concept enables the model to transform sequences of one modality into sequences of another.
4. Discuss the advantages of attention-based mechanisms in text processing models.
ans-Attention mechanisms allow models to focus on specific parts of input sequences while generating outputs.

5. Explain the concept of self-attention mechanism and its advantages in natural language processing.
ans-Self-attention mechanism allows a model to consider different positions in an input sequence when encoding each word. It computes weighted sums of all words' embeddings, where weights are determined by the similarity between words' embeddings. This captures dependencies between words regardless of their distance, making it effective for tasks like machine translation and sentiment analysis.
6. What is the transformer architecture, and how does it improve upon traditional RNN-based models in text processing?
ans-The Transformer architecture improves upon RNNs by using self-attention mechanisms to capture dependencies between words without sequential processing.
