answers-

**Q1) If in a certain language CHAMPION is coded as HCMAIPNO, how can NEGATIVE be coded in that code?**
- CHAMPION -> HCMAIPNO
- NEGATIVE -> ????

The given code appears to be reversing the letters in each word. So, applying the same pattern to "NEGATIVE," we get: EVITAGEN. However, the letters within each word may also be rearranged. So, the answer could be either "EVITAGEN" or "EVITANGE." Unfortunately, without more information, we cannot determine the exact order of letters within the words.

So, the answer is either **EVITAGEN** or **EVITANGE**.

**Q2) If in a certain language GAMBLE is coded as FBLCKF, how can FLOWER be coded in that language?**
- GAMBLE -> FBLCKF
- FLOWER -> ????

The given code seems to shift each letter one position forward in the alphabet. Applying the same pattern to "FLOWER," we get: **GMPVFS**.

So, the answer is **GMPVFS**.

**Q3) If FRIEND is coded as HUMJTK, how can CANDLE be written in that code?**
- FRIEND -> HUMJTK
- CANDLE -> ????

The given code appears to be shifting each letter two positions forward in the alphabet. Applying the same pattern to "CANDLE," we get: **ECPNGJ**.

So, the answer is **ECPNGJ**.

**Q4) If FULFNHW is coded as CRICKET, EULGH will be coded as:**
- FULFNHW -> CRICKET

So, the answer is **DRKFH**.

**Q5) If PALE is coded as 2134, EARTH is coded as 41590, how can PEARL be coded in that language?**
- PALE -> 2134
- EARTH -> 41590
- PEARL -> ????

The code appears to assign a number to each letter based on its position in the alphabet, with 'A' being 1, 'B' being 2, and so on. Applying the same pattern to "PEARL," we get: **165182**.

So, the answer is **165182**.

**Q6) If ROSE is coded as 6821, CHAIR is coded as 73456, and PREACH is coded as 961473, what will be the code for SEARCH?**
- ROSE -> 6821
- CHAIR -> 73456
- PREACH -> 961473
- SEARCH -> ????

The code appears to assign numbers to each letter based on their positions in the alphabet, with 'A' being 1, 'B' being 2, and so on. Applying the same pattern to "SEARCH," we get: **192835**.

So, the answer is **192835**.

**Q7) In a certain code ‘HEAT’ is written as ‘? * $ @’ and ‘FINGER’ is written as ‘! £ • & * #’. How can ‘FATHER’ be written in that code?**
- HEAT -> ? * $ @
- FINGER -> ! £ • & * #

The code appears to replace each letter with a symbol or character. Let's apply the same pattern to "FATHER":
- F -> !
- A -> £
- T -> *
- H -> #
- E -> ?

So, the code for "FATHER" is **!£*#?**.

**Q8) If Z = 52 and ACT = 48, then BAT will be equal to:**
- Z = 52
- ACT = 48
- BAT = ????

Let's analyze this:
- The sum of the positions of the letters in "ACT" is 1 + 3 + 20 = 24.
- The sum of the positions of the letters in "BAT" is 2 + 1 + 20 = 23.

So, BAT = 23.

  - TIGO RHO MISTO -> SWEET FLOWER FRAGRANCE
  - MISTO SCO TIMPO -> SWEET THAN SMILE

The word common to all three sentences is "FLOWER." Therefore, **FLOWER** represents "FRAGRANCE" in that language.

**Q13) In a certain code, 247 means SPREAD RED CARPET, 256 means DUST ONE CARPET, and 264 means ONE RED CARPET. Which digit in that code means DUST?**
- To find the code for "DUST," we need to identify the common digit in all three codes (247, 256, and 264). The common digit is **6**.

So, **6** means "DUST."

- Based on the given information:
  - "LIL CE PEE" means "ROSE ARE BLUE"
  - "ILK HEE" means "RED FLOWERS"
  - "PEE MIT HEE" means "FLOWERS ARE VEGETABLES"

We can break down the given phrase as follows:
- "VEGETABLES" -> "FLOWERS ARE VEGETABLES" (PEE MIT HEE)
- "ARE" -> CE
- "RED FLOWERS" -> ILK HEE

So, the code for "VEGETABLES ARE RED FLOWERS" is **PEE CE ILK HEE**.
