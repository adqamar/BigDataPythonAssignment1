1. Can you explain the concept of feature extraction in convolutional neural networks (CNNs)?
ans- Feature extraction in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) involves capturing meaningful patterns or features from raw input data, often images. CNNs use convolutional layers to automatically learn hierarchical features such as edges, textures, and more complex structures. These layers apply a set of learnable filters (kernels) to the input image, producing feature maps that highlight specific patterns. Through subsequent layers like pooling and fully connected layers, the network gradually learns more abstract and high-level features that are essential for the given task.
2. How does backpropagation work in the context of computer vision tasks?
ans-Backpropagation is a fundamental training algorithm for neural networks, including CNNs in computer vision. It involves two main steps: forward propagation, where input data is passed through the network to make predictions, and backward propagation, where the network's errors are computed and gradients with respect to the model's parameters are calculated. These gradients indicate how much each parameter should be adjusted to minimize the prediction error. Optimization algorithms, like gradient descent, then update the model's parameters iteratively to improve its performance on the given task.
3. What are the benefits of using transfer learning in CNNs, and how does it work?
ans-Transfer learning involves using a pre-trained neural network model as a starting point for a new, related task. Benefits include faster training, improved performance, and the ability to work with smaller datasets. In transfer learning for CNNs, the lower-level features learned by the network in earlier layers are often generic (e.g., edge detectors), while higher-level features are more task-specific. By reusing these lower-level features and retraining only the upper layers, the network can quickly adapt to the new task with limited data.
4. Describe different techniques for data augmentation in CNNs and their impact on model performance.
ans-Data augmentation involves creating new training examples by applying various transformations to the original data.

23. What is the role of anchor boxes in object detection models like SSD and Faster R-CNN?
ans-Anchor boxes are predefined bounding box shapes and sizes that are placed at different positions in an image. In models like SSD and Faster R-CNN, anchor boxes help the network predict object locations and sizes at multiple scales. The network learns to adjust these anchors to fit actual objects during training.
24. Can you explain the architecture and working principles of the Mask R-CNN model?
