answers-

**Percentages:**

1) The batsman scored 110 runs, and 3 fours and 8 sixes account for 30 runs (12 from fours and 18 from sixes). So, the runs made by running between the wickets are 110 - 30 = 80. To find the percentage, we use the formula: (Runs made by running / Total runs) * 100 = (80 / 110) * 100 = 72.73%. So, the answer is not in the options.

2) Let the marks obtained by the two students be A and B. According to the given information, A = B + 9 and A = 0.56(A + B). Substitute A in terms of B into the second equation: B + 9 = 0.56(B + B). Now, solve for B: B + 9 = 1.12B. 9 = 0.12B. B = 75. So, A = 75 + 9 = 84. The marks obtained by them are 84 and 75, so the answer is not in the options.

3) Let the original number of apples be X. The seller sells 40% of them and still has 420 apples. So, 60% of X = 420. To find X, we can use the formula: (60/100) * X = 420. Solving for X, we get X = 700. So, the original number of apples was 700.

4) Numbers from 1 to 70, inclusive, have 7 numbers ending in 1 (1, 11, 21, 31, 41, 51, and 61) and 7 numbers ending in 9 (9, 19, 29, 39, 49, 59, and 69). So, there are 14 numbers out of 70 with 1 or 9 in the unit's digit. To find the percentage, we use the formula: (Number of numbers with 1 or 9 in the unit's digit / Total numbers) * 100 = (14 / 70) * 100 = 20%. So, the answer is option c) 20%.

5) The first decrease is from Rs. 120 to Rs. 100, which is a decrease of (120 - 100) / 120 * 100% = 16.67%. The second decrease is from Rs. 100 to Rs. 80, which is a decrease of (100 - 80) / 100 * 100% = 20%. So, the second decrease is larger. The answer is option b) 2nd is larger.

6) If 20% of a = b, then b% of 20 is the same as: (b/100) * 20 = (20b/100) = (1/5)b. So, the answer is not in the options.

7) Let the total number of students be T. 20% of students are below 8 years old, which is 0.2T. The number of students above 8 years old is 2/3 of the number of students of 8 years old, which is (2/3) * 48 = 32. So, T = 0.2T + 32. Solving for T, we get T = 40/0.8 = 50. So, the total number of students in the school is 50.

8) Let A and B be the two numbers. The equation can be written as: 0.05A + 0.04B = (2/3)(0.06A + 0.08B). Simplify the equation: 0.05A + 0.04B = 0.04A + 0.0533B. Now, rearrange: 0.01A = 0.0133B. A/B = 0.0133/0.01 = 1.33. So, the ratio of A to B is 4:3. The answer is option d) 4:3.

9) The student multiplied a number by 3/5 instead of 5/3. The percentage error is: |(5/3 - 3/5) / (5/3)| * 100% = |(25/15 - 9/15) / (5/3)| * 100% = |(16/15) / (5/3)| * 100% = (16/15) * (3/5) * 100% = 96%. So, the answer is option c) 54%.

10) 20% of the votes were invalid, so valid votes are 80% of the total. 80% of 7500 is (80/100) * 7500 = 6000. The candidate got 55% of the valid votes, which is (55/100) * 6000 = 3300 votes. So, the number of valid votes that the other candidate got is 6000 - 3300 = 2700. The answer is option a) 2700.

**Profit & Loss:**

1) Alfred buys the scooter for Rs. 4700 and spends Rs. 800 on its repairs, making his total cost Rs. 4700 + Rs. 800 = Rs. 5500. He sells it for Rs. 5800. His gain percent is ((Selling Price - Cost Price) / Cost Price) * 100% = ((5800 - 5500) / 5500) * 100% = (300 / 5500) * 100% = 5.45%. So, the answer is option b) 5.45%.

2) Let the cost price of each article be Rs. X, and there are 20 articles. The selling price is also X because the cost price of 20 articles equals the selling price of x articles. The profit is 25%, so the selling price is 125% of the cost price. Therefore, 125% of X equals X. We can write this as (125/100) * X = X. Now, solve for X: (5/4) * X = X. This implies that X cancels out, and we are left with 5/4 = 1, which is not possible. This problem doesn't have a valid solution.

3) If the selling price is doubled, the profit triples. Let the original profit percent be P%. When the selling price is doubled, the new profit percent becomes 3P%. So, we have:

3P% = 2P% + P%
3P% = 3P%

The profit percent triples when the selling price is doubled. So, the profit percent is 3P%.

4) The profit is 320% of the cost, which means the selling price is 420% of the cost. Now, if the cost increases by 25%, the new cost will be 125% of the original cost. The selling price remains constant at 420% of the original cost.

To find the profit percentage as a percentage of the selling price, we calculate: (420% - 125%) / 420% * 100% = (295% / 420%) * 100% = (59/84) * 100% ≈ 70.24%. So, approximately 70.24% of the selling price is the profit. The answer is option b) 70%.

5) The vendor buys toffees at 6 for a rupee, which means the cost of one toffee is 1/6 rupee. To gain 20%, he needs to sell it for 1/6 + (20/100) * (1/6) = 1/6 + 1/30 = 6/30 + 1/30 = 7/30 rupees.

So, he needs to sell each toffee for 7/30 rupees. To find how many for a rupee, we take the reciprocal: 30/7. Therefore, he needs to sell 30/7 toffees for a rupee to gain 20%. The answer is not in the options.

6) Let the cost price be C and the selling price be S. According to the information given, we have two equations:

1) S - C = 1920 (25% profit)
2) C - S = 1280 (25% loss)

Now, add both equations:

(S - C) + (C - S) = 1920 + 1280

Simplify:

0 = 3200

This is not possible, as it implies 0 = 3200, which is not true. Therefore, the problem doesn't have a valid solution.

7) The shopkeeper expects a gain of 22.5% on his cost price. If his sale was Rs. 392, we can calculate his cost price (CP):

Gain = (Gain Percentage / 100) * CP
22.5% = (22.5 / 100) * CP
0.225CP = 392

CP = 392 / 0.225 = Rs. 1742.22

His profit is the selling price (Rs. 392) minus the cost price (Rs. 1742.22):

Profit = Rs. 392 - Rs. 1742.22 ≈ Rs. -1350.22

So, his profit is approximately Rs. -1350.22. This means he incurred a loss. The answer is not in the options.

8) A man buys a cycle for Rs. 1400 and sells it at a loss of 15%. To find the selling price (SP), we calculate:

Loss = (Loss Percentage / 100) * Cost Price
15% = (15 / 100) * 1400
0.15 * 1400 = Rs. 210

SP = CP - Loss = Rs. 1400 - Rs. 210 = Rs. 1190

So, the selling price of the cycle is Rs. 1190. The answer is option c) Rs. 1190.

9) Sam purchased 20 dozens of toys at the rate of Rs. 375 per dozen, which means the cost of one dozen toys is Rs. 375. He sold each one of them at the rate of Rs. 33 per dozen, which means the selling price for one dozen toys is Rs. 33. 

Profit per dozen = Selling price per dozen - Cost price per dozen = Rs. 33 - Rs. 375 = Rs. -342

Profit percent = (Profit per dozen / Cost price per dozen) * 100% = (-342 / 375) * 100% ≈ -91.2%

So, the percentage profit is approximately -91.2%, which means Sam incurred a loss. The answer is not in the options.

10) If articles are bought at 6 for a rupee, it means the cost of one article is 1/6 rupee. To gain 20%, they need to be sold for (1/6) + (20/100) * (1/6) = (1/6) + (1/30) = (6/30) + (1/30) = 7/30 rupees each.

So, the vendor needs to sell each article for 7/30 rupees. To find how many for a rupee, take the reciprocal: 30/7. Therefore, he needs to sell 30/7 articles for a rupee to gain 20%. The answer is not in the options.

11) Let the cost price of each ball be C. According to the given information:

Selling Price of 17 balls = Cost Price of 17 balls - Cost Price of 5 balls

720 = 17C - 5C
720 = 12C

C = 720 / 12
C = 60

So, the cost price of each ball is Rs. 60. The answer is option d) Rs. 60.

12) When a plot is sold for Rs. 18,700, the owner loses 15%. To find the cost price (CP) of the plot, we can use:

Loss = (Loss Percentage / 100) * CP
15% = (15 / 100) * CP
0.15CP = 18,700



CP = 18,700 / 0.15 = Rs. 1,24,666.67 (approx)

To gain 15%, the selling price (SP) should be:

SP = CP + Profit
SP = 1,24,666.67 + (15/100) * 1,24,666.67
SP ≈ 1,43,866.67

So, the plot should be sold for approximately Rs. 1,43,866.67 to gain 15%. The answer is not in the options.

13) The cost price (CP) of 100 oranges is Rs. 350, which means the cost price of one orange is Rs. 350/100 = Rs. 3.50.

The selling price (SP) of 100 oranges at the rate of Rs. 48 per dozen is:

SP = (100 / 12) * 48 = 400

Profit per orange = SP per orange - CP per orange = Rs. 4 - Rs. 3.50 = Rs. 0.50

Profit percentage = (Profit per orange / CP per orange) * 100% = (0.50 / 3.50) * 100% = (1/7) * 100% ≈ 14.28%

So, the percentage profit is approximately 14.28%. The answer is option a) 14.28% gain.

14) Let the cost price of the first transistor be C1 and the cost price of the second transistor be C2. The selling price of the first transistor is Rs. 840 with a 20% gain, so:

SP1 = C1 + (20/100) * C1 = 1.20C1

The selling price of the second transistor is Rs. 960 with a 4% loss, so:

SP2 = C2 - (4/100) * C2 = 0.96C2

Total gain/loss percent is given by:

(Total SP - Total CP) / Total CP * 100%

Total SP = SP1 + SP2 = 1.20C1 + 0.96C2
Total CP = C1 + C2

So,

(Total SP - Total CP) / Total CP * 100% = [(1.20C1 + 0.96C2) - (C1 + C2)] / (C1 + C2) * 100%

Simplify:

(0.20C1 - 0.04C2) / (C1 + C2) * 100%

We don't have enough information about C1 and C2 to determine the exact percentage, so the answer is none of the provided options.

15) Let x kg of the first variety of rice be mixed with 30 kg of the second variety of rice. The total mixture weighs (x + 30) kg.

Given that the mixture is sold at Rs. 30 per kg, the total revenue from the mixture is 30(x + 30).

Now, let's find the cost price (CP) of the mixture. The CP of x kg of the first variety of rice is 20x, and the CP of 30 kg of the second variety of rice is 36 * 30 = 1080.

So, the total CP of the mixture is 20x + 1080.

Since the profit is zero, the total revenue must equal the total CP:

30(x + 30) = 20x + 1080

Solve for x:

30x + 900 = 20x + 1080
10x = 180
x = 18

So, 18 kg of the first variety of rice is mixed with 30 kg of the second variety of rice. The profit percent is:

Profit Percent = (Total Revenue - Total CP) / Total CP * 100
Profit Percent = [30(x + 30) - (20x + 1080)] / (20x + 1080) * 100
Profit Percent = [30(18 + 30) - (20 * 18 + 1080)] / (20 * 18 + 1080) * 100
Profit Percent ≈ (30 * 48 - 360) / (360 + 1080) * 100
Profit Percent ≈ (1440 - 360) / 1440 * 100
Profit Percent ≈ 1080 / 1440 * 100
Profit Percent ≈ 75%

So, the profit percent is 75%. The answer is option c) 8%.

16) A tradesman defrauds by means of a false weight balance to an extent of 10% in buying goods and to the same extent in selling goods. This means that when buying, he pays 10% less than the actual cost, and when selling, he charges 10% more than the actual price.

Let the actual cost price of the goods be C and the actual selling price be S. 

When buying, he pays 10% less, so he pays 0.9C for goods with a cost of C.

When selling, he charges 10% more, so he charges 1.1S for goods with a selling price of S.

Now, let's calculate the overall percentage gain:

Overall Percentage Gain = [(Selling Price - Cost Price) / Cost Price] * 100
Overall Percentage Gain = [(1.1S - 0.9C) / 0.9C] * 100

Simplify:

Overall Percentage Gain = [(1.1S/0.9C) - 1] * 100

Overall Percentage Gain = [(11/9) * (S/C) - 1] * 100

We have the ratio of the density of gold to water, which is 15, and the ratio of the density of copper to water, which is 7. To get an alloy 13 times as heavy as water, the ratio of gold to copper in the alloy must be 15:7.

So, let's assume the alloy contains 15x kg of gold and 7x kg of copper.

The total weight of the alloy (15x + 7x) should be 13 times the weight of water.

Therefore, 22x = 13 * 1

Solve for x:

x = 13/22

Now, the ratio of gold to copper in the alloy is (15x)/(7x) = 15/7.

So, the alloy contains gold and copper in the ratio of 15:7, which is the required ratio.

The answer is option a) 3:1.

15) Rs. 730 were divided among A, B, C in such a way that if A gets Rs. 3, then B gets Rs. 4, and if B gets Rs. 3.50, then C gets Rs. 3.

Let the amount A receives be 3x, B receives be 4x, and C receives be 3.50x.

According to the given conditions:

3x + 4x + 3.50x = 730

10.5x = 730

x = 730 / 10.5

x = 70

Now, we can find the share of each person:



A's share = 3x = 3 * 70 = Rs. 210
B's share = 4x = 4 * 70 = Rs. 280
C's share = 3.50x = 3.50 * 70 = Rs. 245

The share of B exceeds that of C by:

280 - 245 = Rs. 35

So, B's share exceeds C's share by Rs. 35. The answer is option c) 70.

16) The ratio of income of A to that of B is 5:4, which means A earns 5x and B earns 4x for some positive number x.

The ratio of expenditure of A to that of B is 3:2, which means A spends 3y and B spends 2y for some positive number y.

If at the end of the year, each saves Rs. 800, we can write the equation:

Income - Expenditure = Savings

(5x - 3y) = 800 (for A)
(4x - 2y) = 800 (for B)

Now, let's solve this system of equations:

5x - 3y = 800
4x - 2y = 800

We can simplify the second equation by dividing both sides by 2:

2x - y = 400

Now, let's multiply the second equation by 3 so that we can eliminate y:

3(2x - y) = 3(400)
6x - 3y = 1200

Now, subtract the first equation from the second:

(6x - 3y) - (5x - 3y) = 1200 - 800
6x - 3y - 5x + 3y = 400
x = 400

Now that we have found the value of x, we can find A's income and expenditure:

A's income = 5x = 5 * 400 = Rs. 2000
A's expenditure = 3y = 3 * 400 = Rs. 1200

So, A's income is Rs. 2000, and B's income is 4x = 4 * 400 = Rs. 1600.

The answer is option c) Rs. 2000.

17) A sum of money is to be divided among P, Q, and R in the ratio of 2:3:5. Let the common ratio be x.

So, the shares are:

P's share = 2x
Q's share = 3x
R's share = 5x

Given that the total share of P and R together is Rs 400 more than that of Q, we can write the equation:

2x + 5x = 3x + 400

Simplify:

7x = 3x + 400

Subtract 3x from both sides:

4x = 400

Divide by 4:

x = 100

Now, we can find the shares:

P's share = 2x = 2 * 100 = Rs. 200
Q's share = 3x = 3 * 100 = Rs. 300
R's share = 5x = 5 * 100 = Rs. 500

So, R's share in it is Rs. 500. The answer is option d) Rs. 500.

18) x varies inversely as the square of y. Given that y = 2 for x = 1, we can write:

x ∝ 1/y^2

Using the given values:

1 ∝ 1/2^2
1 ∝ 1/4

Now, for y = 6, we need to find x:

x ∝ 1/6^2
x ∝ 1/36

To find the actual value of x, we can set up a proportion:

1/4 = x/36

Cross-multiply:

4 * x = 1 * 36

x = 36/4

x = 9

So, when y = 6, x = 9. The answer is option b) 9.

19) Let's call the amount of sweets B initially has as "x" kg. So, initially, A has 110 - x kg and C has 110 - x kg of sweets.

According to the information:

1. If A gives half of his share to B, then B now has twice as much as A. This means:

   B + (110 - x)/2 = 2 * (110 - x)

2. If C gives half of his share to B, then B now has four times as much as C. This means:

   B + (110 - x)/2 = 4 * (110 - x)

Now, you have a system of two equations with two variables (x and B). Solve this system to find the value of x and B:

Equation 1: B + (110 - x)/2 = 2 * (110 - x)
Equation 2: B + (110 - x)/2 = 4 * (110 - x)

Subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:

(4 * (110 - x)) - (2 * (110 - x)) = 0

Simplify:

2 * (110 - x) = 0

Divide by 2:

110 - x = 0

x = 110

So, initially, B has x kg of sweets, which is 110 kg. The answer is option d) 110.

Let's continue with the remaining questions:

**Ratios & Proportions:**

1) The length and breadth of a rectangle are increased in the ratio 3:4 and 4:5 respectively. What is the ratio of the old area to the new one?

To find the ratio of the old area to the new one, we need to use the given ratios for length and breadth.

Old length ratio = 3
New length ratio = 4

Old breadth ratio = 4
New breadth ratio = 5

Old area ratio = (Old length ratio) * (Old breadth ratio) = 3 * 4 = 12
New area ratio = (New length ratio) * (New breadth ratio) = 4 * 5 = 20

So, the ratio of the old area to the new area is 12:20, which can be simplified to 3:5. The answer is option b) 3:5.

2) 3 pots have the same volume. The ratios of milk and water in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd pots are respectively 3:2, 7:3, and 11:4. If all three pots are mixed, find the ratio of milk and water in the mixture?

Let's calculate the total ratio of milk and water in each pot:

1st pot ratio = 3:2
2nd pot ratio = 7:3
3rd pot ratio = 11:4

Now, calculate the total ratios by adding the corresponding components:

Total milk ratio = 3 + 7 + 11 = 21
Total water ratio = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9

So, the overall ratio of milk to water in the mixture is 21:9, which can be simplified to 7:3. The answer is option b) 7:3.

3) If (a+b):(b+c):(c+a) = 6:7:8 and (a + b + c) = 14, then the value of c is?

From the given ratios:

(a+b):(b+c):(c+a) = 6:7:8

We know that (a+b+c) = 14.

Let's assume a constant k such that:

(a+b) = 6k
(b+c) = 7k
(c+a) = 8k

Now, add these equations:

(a+b) + (b+c) + (c+a) = 6k + 7k + 8k = 21k

But we know that (a+b+c) = 14. So, we have:

21k = 14

Now, solve for k:

k = 14 / 21
k = 2/3

Now that we have the value of k, we can find the value of c:

(c+a) = 8k
(c+a) = 8 * (2/3)
(c+a) = 16/3

But we know that (a+b+c) = 14. So, we have:

(c+a) = 14 - b

Now, equate these two expressions:

16/3 = 14 - b

To find b, subtract 16/3 from 14:

b = 14 - 16/3
b = (42/3) - (16/3)
b = 26/3

Now that we have b, we can find c:

(c+b) = 7k
(c+26/3) = 7 * (2/3)

Now, solve for c:

c + 26/3 = 14/3

Subtract 26/3 from both sides:

c = 14/3 - 26/3
c = -12/3
c = -4

So, the value of c is -4.

4) The sum of three numbers is 136. If the ratio between the first and second be 2:3 and that between the second and third is 5:3, then the second number is?

Let's assume the three numbers are 2x, 3x, and 5x, where x is a common factor.

According to the given ratio:

1st number : 2nd number = 2:3
2nd number : 3rd number = 5:3

We can write these ratios as equations:

(2x) / (3x) = 2/3
(3x) / (5x) = 5/3

Now, solve these equations to find the values of x:

1st equation:
(2x) / (3x) = 2/3

Cross-multiply:

2 * 3x = 2 * 2x

6x = 4x

Now, we have x = 0. This doesn't make sense in this context because we can't have zero as a common factor.

Let's recheck the problem:

The sum of three numbers is 136. 

2x + 3x + 5x = 136

10x = 136

Now, solve for x:

x = 136 / 10

x = 13.6

**Ratios & Proportions (Continued):**

5) In a bag, there are coins of 25 p, 10 p, and 5 p in the ratio of 1:2:3. If there are Rs. 30 in all, how many 5 p coins are there?

Let's assume that the common factor of the ratios is "x." So, we have:

1x for 25 p coins
2x for 10 p coins
3x for 5 p coins

The total value of coins in the bag is given as Rs. 30, which is 300 paise.

Now, we can set up an equation based on the values of the coins and their quantities:

(1x * 25) + (2x * 10) + (3x * 5) = 300

Simplify and solve for x:

25x + 20x + 15x = 300

60x = 300

Now, divide by 60 to find the value of x:

x = 300 / 60
x = 5

Now that we have found the value of x, we can determine the number of 5 p coins:

Number of 5 p coins = 3x = 3 * 5 = 15

So, there are 15 five-paise coins in the bag. The answer is option d) 200.

6) If x:y = 5:2, then (8x + 9y):(8x + 2y) is:

We have:

x:y = 5:2

Now, let's calculate the values of 8x + 9y and 8x + 2y:

8x + 9y = 8(5) + 9(2) = 40 + 18 = 58
8x + 2y = 8(5) + 2(2) = 40 + 4 = 44

So, (8x + 9y):(8x + 2y) = 58:44.

To simplify this ratio, we can find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 58 and 44, which is 2:

58/2 : 44/2 = 29 : 22

So, (8x + 9y):(8x + 2y) simplifies to 29:22. The answer is option a) 29:22.

7) If A:B = 2:3, B:C = 4:5, and C:D = 6:7, then A:B:C:D is:

To find A:B:C:D, we need to combine the given ratios. Let's calculate each step:

A:B = 2:3
B:C = 4:5
C:D = 6:7

Now, let's combine them:

A:B:C = (2:3) * (4:5) = 8:12:15
B:C:D = (4:5) * (6:7) = 24:30:35

Now, we have the ratios for A:B:C and B:C:D. To find A:B:C:D, we can merge these two ratios:

A:B:C:D = 8:12:15:35

So, the ratio of A:B:C:D is 8:12:15:35. The answer is option d) 18:24:30:35.

8) If A:B = 8:15, B:C = 5:8, and C:D = 4:5, then A:D is equal to:

To find A:D, we need to combine the given ratios. Let's calculate each step:

A:B = 8:15
B:C = 5:8
C:D = 4:5

Now, let's combine them:

A:B:C = (8:15) * (5:8) = 40:75:120
B:C:D = (5:8) * (4:5) = 20:32:40

Now, we have the ratios for A:B:C and B:C:D. To find A:D, we can merge these two ratios:

A:B:C:D = 40:75:120:40

To simplify this ratio, we can find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numbers:

GCD(40, 75, 120, 40) = 5

Now, divide each number by 5:

A:D = (40/5):(75/5):(120/5):(40/5) = 8:15:24:8

So, the ratio of A:D is 8:15:24:8. The answer is option c) 8:15:24:8.

9) A sum of Rs. 427 is to be divided among A, B, and C such that 3 times A’s share, 4 times B’s share, and 7 times C’s share are all equal. The share of C is:

Let the shares of A, B, and C be 3x, 4x, and 7x, respectively.

According to the given information:

3x = 4x = 7x

Now, we can set up an equation based on the total sum:

3x + 4x + 7x = 427

Combine like terms:

14x = 427

Now, divide by 14 to find the value of x:

x = 427 / 14
x = 30.5

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the share of C:

C's share = 7x = 7 * 30.5 = Rs. 213.5

So, the share of C is Rs. 213.5. The answer is option c) Rs. 213.5.

10) The least whole number which, when subtracted from both the terms of the ratio 6:7 to give a ratio less than 16:21, is:

Let's assume the number to be subtracted from both terms of the ratio is "n."

So, we have:

(6 - n) : (7 - n) < 16 : 21

Now, we can cross-multiply:

(6 - n) * 21 < (7 - n) * 16

Expand both sides:

126 - 21n < 112 - 16n

Now, let's isolate the variable "n" on one side of the inequality:

-21n + 16n < 112 - 126

-5n < -14

Now, divide both sides by -5, but remember to reverse the inequality sign since we are dividing by a negative number:

n > 14 / 5

n > 2.8

Since "n" must be a whole number, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to satisfy the condition:

n ≥ 3

So, the least whole number to be subtracted from both terms of the ratio 6:7 to give a ratio less than 16:21 is 3. The answer is option b) 3.

11) X, Y, and Z share a sum of money in the ratio 7:8:16. If Z receives Rs. 

27 more than X, then the total money shared was:

Let's assume the shares of X, Y, and Z to be 7x, 8x, and 16x, respectively.

According to the given information, Z receives Rs. 27 more than X:

16x - 7x = 27

Now, solve for x:

9x = 27

x = 27 / 9
x = 3

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the total money shared:

Total money shared = 7x + 8x + 16x = 31x

Substitute the value of x:

Total money shared = 31 * 3 = Rs. 93

So, the total money shared was Rs. 93. The answer is option c) Rs. 93.

12) What number should be added to each of the numbers 8, 21, 13, and 31 so that the resulting numbers form a proportion?

To make the resulting numbers form a proportion, we need to ensure that the ratios of the numbers are equal.

Let's assume the number to be added is "x."

So, the resulting numbers will be:

8 + x, 21 + x, 13 + x, 31 + x

Now, let's set up the ratios:

(8 + x) : (21 + x) = (13 + x) : (31 + x)

Now, we can cross-multiply to find the condition for a proportion:

(8 + x) * (31 + x) = (13 + x) * (21 + x)

Expand both sides:

(8x + x^2 + 248 + 31x) = (13x + x^2 + 273 + 21x)

Now, simplify:

39x + x^2 + 248 = 34x + x^2 + 273

Now, let's isolate the variable "x" on one side:

39x - 34x = 273 - 248

5x = 25

Now, divide by 5 to find the value of x:

x = 25 / 5
x = 5

So, the number that should be added to each of the numbers 8, 21, 13, and 31 to make them form a proportion is 5. The answer is option b) 5.

13) The salaries of A, B, and C are in the ratio of 1:2:3. The salary of B and C together is Rs. 6000. By what percent is the salary of C more than that of A?

Let's assume the salaries of A, B, and C to be x, 2x, and 3x, respectively.

According to the given information, the salary of B and C together is Rs. 6000:

2x + 3x = 6000

Now, solve for x:

5x = 6000

x = 6000 / 5
x = 1200

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the salaries of A, B, and C:

Salary of A = x = 1200
Salary of B = 2x = 2 * 1200 = 2400
Salary of C = 3x = 3 * 1200 = 3600

Now, we can find the percentage by which the salary of C is more than that of A:

Percentage increase = [(C's salary - A's salary) / A's salary] * 100
Percentage increase = [(3600 - 1200) / 1200] * 100
Percentage increase = (2400 / 1200) * 100
Percentage increase = 200%

So, the salary of C is 200% more than that of A. The answer is option d) 200%.

14) Gold is 15 times as heavy as water, and copper is 7 times as heavy as water. In what ratio should these be mixed to get an alloy 13 times as heavy as water?

Let's assume the ratio of gold to copper in the alloy to be x:y.

According to the given information:

Gold is 15 times as heavy as water, so the density of gold = 15
Copper is 7 times as heavy as water, so the density of copper = 7
The desired alloy is 13 times as heavy as water, so the density of the alloy = 13

Now, we can set up a proportion based on the densities:

(x * 15 + y * 7) / (x + y) = 13

Now, we need to solve for the ratio x:y. However, this equation does not have a unique solution because there are multiple possible values of x and y that satisfy the given conditions.

Therefore, the answer is "None of these" (option d) CND).

15) Rs. 730 were divided among A, B, and C in such a way that if A gets Rs. 3, then B gets Rs. 4, and if B gets Rs. 3.50, then C gets Rs. 3. The share of B exceeds that of C by?

Let's assume the shares of A, B, and C to be 3x, 4x, and 3.50x, respectively.

According to the given information:

If A gets Rs. 3, then B gets Rs. 4:

3x = 3
4x = 4

Now, we can set up an equation based on the share of B exceeding that of C:

4x - 3.50x = 0.50x

Now, calculate the difference in their shares:

0.50x = 0.50 * 3
0.50x = 1.50

So, the share of B exceeds that of C by Rs. 1.50. The answer is option c) 70.

16) The ratio of income of A to that of B is 5:4, and the expenditure of A to that of B is 3:2. If at the end of the year, each saves Rs. 800, the income of A is:

Let's assume the income of A to be 5x and the income of B to be 4x.

According to the given information, the expenditure of A to that of B is 3:2:

(Expenditure of A) / (Expenditure of B) = 3/2

Now, let's assume the expenditure of A to be 3y and the expenditure of B to be 2y. So, we have:

(3y) / (2y) = 3/2

Now, calculate the ratio of income to expenditure for both A and B:

(Income of A) / (Expenditure of A) = (5x) / (3y)
(Income of B) / (Expenditure of B) = (4x) / (2y)

Now, it's given that each saves Rs. 800 at the end of the year. This means that the savings are equal to the income minus the expenditure for both A and B:

Savings of A = (Income of A) - (Expenditure of A) = 5x

 - 3y
Savings of B = (Income of B) - (Expenditure of B) = 4x - 2y

According to the given information, both A and B save Rs. 800 each, so we can set up the following equations:

5x - 3y = 800
4x - 2y = 800

Now, let's solve this system of equations to find the value of x (the income of A):

From the second equation, we can express 2y in terms of x:

2y = 4x - 800

Now, substitute this expression for 2y into the first equation:

5x - (4x - 800) = 800

Simplify and solve for x:

5x - 4x + 800 = 800

x + 800 = 800

x = 0

So, the income of A is 0. However, this result doesn't seem realistic, and there might be an issue with the given information or equations. Please double-check the problem statement for accuracy.

17) A sum of money is to be divided among P, Q, and R in the ratio of 2:3:5. If the total share of P and R together is Rs. 400 more than that of Q, what is R’s share in it?

Let's assume the shares of P, Q, and R to be 2x, 3x, and 5x, respectively.

According to the given information, the total share of P and R together is Rs. 400 more than that of Q:

(2x + 5x) - 3x = 400

Now, solve for x:

7x - 3x = 400

4x = 400

x = 400 / 4
x = 100

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the share of R:

R's share = 5x = 5 * 100 = Rs. 500

So, R’s share is Rs. 500. The answer is option c) Rs. 500.

18) x varies inversely as the square of y. Given that y = 2 for x = 1. The value of x for y = 6 will be equal to:

We are given that x varies inversely as the square of y, which can be expressed as:

x ∝ 1/y^2

Now, we are also given that y = 2 when x = 1. We can use this information to find the constant of variation (k):

1 = k / (2^2)

1 = k / 4

k = 4

Now that we have the value of k, we can find x when y = 6:

x ∝ 1/y^2

x = k / (6^2)

x = 4 / 36

x = 1/9

So, when y = 6, x = 1/9. The answer is option a) 1/9.

19) If A, B & C have a total of 110 kg of sweets with them. If A gives half of his share to B, then he now has twice as much as B. But if C gives half of his share to B, then B now has four times as much as that of C. What amount of sweets does B have initially?

Let's assume the initial shares of A, B, and C to be x, y, and z, respectively.

According to the given information:

1) If A gives half of his share to B, he now has twice as much as B:

x - (1/2)x = 2(y + (1/2)x)

Simplify this equation:

(1/2)x = 2(y + (1/2)x)

2y + x = 2(y + (1/2)x)

x = 2(y + (1/2)x) - 2y

x = y + x - 2y

x = x - y

This equation implies that x = y, which means that A and B initially had the same amount of sweets.

2) If C gives half of his share to B, then B now has four times as much as that of C:

y + (1/2)z = 4(z - (1/2)z)

Simplify this equation:

y + (1/2)z = 4(z - (1/2)z)

y + (1/2)z = 4(1/2)z

y + (1/2)z = 2z

Now, let's substitute x = y into this equation since we found that x = y in the first part:

x + (1/2)z = 2z

Now, we can solve for z:

(1/2)z = 2z - x

z = 4z - 2x

2x = 3z

z = (2/3)x

Now, we know that C had (2/3) of the initial amount of sweets that A and B had.

Since the total amount of sweets is 110 kg, we can set up the following equation:

x + x + (2/3)x = 110

(7/3)x = 110

Now, solve for x:

x = (110 * 3) / 7

x = 330 / 7

x = 47.14 (approximately)

So, A and B initially had 47.14 kg of sweets each, and C initially had (2/3) * 47.14 ≈ 31.43 kg of sweets.

The amount of sweets that B initially had is approximately 47.14 kg.
