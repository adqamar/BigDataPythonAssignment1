answers-
Let's solve the given problems:

**Averages:**

1) The average of the first five multiples of 3 is (3 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 15) / 5 = 45 / 5 = 9.

   Answer: b) 9

2) Let the six numbers be A, B, C, D, E, F.

   We know the average of six numbers is 3.95, so (A + B + C + D + E + F) / 6 = 3.95.

   Also, the average of two of them is 3.4, so (A + B) / 2 = 3.4, which implies A + B = 6.8.

   Similarly, the average of the other two is 3.85, so (C + D) / 2 = 3.85, which implies C + D = 7.7.

   Now, let's find the average of the remaining two numbers, E and F:

   (E + F) / 2 = [(A + B + C + D + E + F) - (A + B + C + D)] / 2 = (6.8 - 7.7) / 2 = (-0.9) / 2 = -0.45.

   So, the average of the remaining two numbers is -0.45.

   Answer: The average of the remaining two numbers is -0.45.

3) The average score for ten matches is 38.9 runs, and the average for the first six matches is 42. To find the average for the last four matches, you can use the formula for the average:

   Average = (Total Sum) / (Total Number of Matches)

   For the first six matches, the total sum is 6 * 42 = 252 runs.

   Now, let's find the total sum for all ten matches using the given average:

   38.9 = (Total Sum) / 10

   Total Sum = 38.9 * 10 = 389 runs.

   Now, subtract the total sum of the first six matches to find the total sum of the last four matches:

   Total Sum of Last Four Matches = 389 - 252 = 137 runs.

   Finally, find the average for the last four matches:

   Average = (Total Sum of Last Four Matches) / 4 = 137 / 4 = 34.25 runs.

   Answer: c) 34.25

4) The average age of 40 students is 15 years. When 10 new students are admitted, the average is increased by 0.2 years.

   Let the average age of the new students be x years.

   According to the given information:

   (40 * 15 + 10x) / 50 = 15 + 0.2

   (600 + 10x) / 50 = 15.2

   600 + 10x = 15.2 * 50

   600 + 10x = 760

   10x = 760 - 600

   10x = 160

   x = 160 / 10

   x = 16

   So, the average age of the new students is 16 years.

   Answer: a) 15.2 yrs

5) The average weight of 16 boys in a class is 50.25 kgs, and that of the remaining 8 boys is 45.15 kgs. To find the average weight of all the boys in the class, you can use the formula for the average:

   Average = (Total Sum) / (Total Number of Boys)

   For the first 16 boys, the total sum is 16 * 50.25 kgs.

   For the remaining 8 boys, the total sum is 8 * 45.15 kgs.

   Now, find the total sum of weights for all the boys:

   Total Sum = (16 * 50.25) + (8 * 45.15)

   Total Sum = 804 + 361.2

   Total Sum = 1165.2 kgs.

   Total Number of Boys = 16 + 8 = 24 boys.

   Finally, find the average weight of all the boys:

   Average = (Total Sum) / (Total Number of Boys) = 1165.2 / 24 ≈ 48.55 kg.

   Answer: a) 48.55 kg

6) Let the five consecutive odd numbers be x, x + 2, x + 4, x + 6, and x + 8.

   The average of these numbers is given as 61:

   (x + x + 2 + x + 4 + x + 6 + x + 8) / 5 = 61

   (5x + 20) / 5 = 61

   5x + 20 = 305

   5x = 305 - 20

   5x = 285

   x = 285 / 5

   x = 57

   So, the five consecutive odd numbers are 57, 59, 61, 63, and 65.

   The difference between the highest (65) and the lowest (57) number is 65 - 57 = 8.

   Answer: c) 8

7) In seven given numbers, the average of the first four numbers is 4, and the average of the last four numbers is also 4. If the average of these seven numbers is 3, the fourth number is:

   Let the first four numbers be a, b, c, and d, and the last three numbers be e, f, and g.

   According to the given information:

   (a + b + c + d) / 4 = 4  [Average of the first four numbers is 4]

   (e + f + g + d) / 4 = 4  [Average of the last four numbers is 4]

   (a + b + c + d + e + f + g) / 7 = 3  [Average of all seven numbers is 3]

   Now, let's solve for d:

   a + b + c + d = 4 * 4 = 16  ...(1)

   e + f + g + d = 4 * 4 = 16  ...(2)

   Adding equations (1) and (2):

   a + b + c + d + e + f + g + d = 16 + 16

   a + b + c + e + f + g + 2d = 32

   (a + b + c + e + f + g) + 2d = 32

   Now, we know that (a + b + c + e + f + g) / 7 = 3 (from the third equation).

   Multiplying both sides by 7 gives:

   a + b + c + e + f + g = 21

   Substituting this value back into the equation:

   21 + 2d = 32

   2d = 32

 - 21

   2d = 11

   d = 11 / 2

   d = 5.5

   Answer: The fourth number is 5.5.

8) The average age of 30 students is 9 years. If the age of their teacher is included, it becomes 10 years.

   Let the age of the teacher be T years.

   According to the given information:

   (Sum of ages of 30 students + T) / 31 = 10  [Average age with the teacher is 10 years]

   Sum of ages of 30 students + T = 31 * 10

   Sum of ages of 30 students + T = 310

   Sum of ages of 30 students = 310 - T

   But we also know that the average age of 30 students is 9 years:

   (Sum of ages of 30 students) / 30 = 9

   Sum of ages of 30 students = 30 * 9

   Sum of ages of 30 students = 270

   Equating the two expressions for the sum of ages of 30 students:

   310 - T = 270

   -T = 270 - 310

   -T = -40

   T = 40

   So, the age of the teacher is 40 years.

   Answer: d) 40

9) The average of 2, 7, 6, and x is 5, which can be expressed as:

   (2 + 7 + 6 + x) / 4 = 5

   15 + x = 4 * 5

   15 + x = 20

   x = 20 - 15

   x = 5

   The average of 18, 1, 6, x, and y is 10, which can be expressed as:

   (18 + 1 + 6 + 5 + y) / 5 = 10

   30 + y = 5 * 10

   30 + y = 50

   y = 50 - 30

   y = 20

   So, the value of y is 20.

   Answer: c) 20

10) A batsman makes a score of 87 runs in the 17th inning and thus increases his average by 3.

    Let the average after the 16th inning be x runs.

    According to the given information:

    (Total runs after 16 innings + 87) / 17 = x + 3

    (16x + 87) / 17 = x + 3

    16x + 87 = 17(x + 3)

    16x + 87 = 17x + 51

    17x - 16x = 87 - 51

    x = 36

    So, the average after the 16th inning is 36 runs.

    After the 17th inning, the average is x + 3 = 36 + 3 = 39 runs.

    Answer: d) 55

11) The mean of 50 observations was 36. It was found later that an observation 48 was wrongly taken as 23. To find the corrected new mean:

    Sum of original observations = 50 * 36 = 1800

    Sum of observations after correction = 1800 - 48 (wrong observation) + 23 (corrected observation)

    Sum of observations after correction = 1800 - 48 + 23 = 1775

    Corrected new mean = Sum of observations after correction / Number of observations

    Corrected new mean = 1775 / 50 = 35.5

    Answer: c) 36.5

12) The average of runs of a cricket player for 10 innings was 32. To increase his average of runs by 4, he must score 4 * 10 = 40 more runs.

    So, in his next innings, he must score 40 runs.

    Answer: d) 76

13) The average weight of 6 men decreases by 3 kg when one of them weighing 80 kg is replaced by a new man. The weight of the new man is:

    Let the weight of the new man be x kg.

    According to the given information:

    (Total weight of 6 men - Weight of the man replaced + Weight of the new man) / 6 = Average weight after the replacement

    (Total weight of 6 men - 80 + x) / 6 = (Average weight before the replacement) - 3

    (Total weight of 6 men - 80 + x) / 6 = (Average weight before the replacement) - 3

    (6 * Average weight before the replacement - 80 + x) / 6 = (Average weight before the replacement) - 3

    6 * Average weight before the replacement - 80 + x = 6 * (Average weight before the replacement) - 18

    80 - 18 + 3 = x

    65 = x

    So, the weight of the new man is 65 kg.

    Answer: a) 56 kg

14) The average of the two-digit numbers, which remain the same when the digits interchange their positions:

    The two-digit numbers that remain the same when the digits interchange are 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, and 99.

    Sum of these numbers = 11 + 22 + 33 + 44 + 55 + 66 + 77 + 88 + 99 = 495

    Total number of such two-digit numbers = 9

    Average = Sum / Total number = 495 / 9 = 55

    Answer: d) 55

15) Let x be the average of six numbers, y be the average of three of these, and z be the average of the remaining three.

    Then, we have:

    x = (y + z) / 2

    2x = y + z

    This means that the average of all six numbers is twice the average of any three of these.

    Answer: b) 2x = y + z

**Mixtures & Alligations:**

1) To find the ratio in which rice at Rs.12 per kg must be mixed with rice at Rs.10.80 per kg to get a mixture worth Rs.10 per kg, you can use the formula for weighted averages:

   Let the ratio be x:y, where x is the quantity of the first type of rice (Rs.12 per kg) and y is the quantity of the second type of rice (Rs.10.80 per kg).

   (12x + 10.80y) / (x + y) = 10

   12x + 10.80y = 10x + 10y

   12x - 10x = 10y - 10.80y

   2x = -0.80y

   x/y = -0.80/2 = -0.40

   x/y =

 2/5

   So, the required ratio is 2:5.

   Answer: b) 2:5

2) Vessel 'A' contains 150 liters of a mixture of milk and water in the ratio of 3:1. Vessel 'B' contains 200 liters of the mixture in the ratio of 5:2. To find the ratio of the resulting mixture when both vessels are mixed, you can use the method of alligations.

   For vessel 'A': Milk to water ratio = 3:1

3) 4 kg of a metal contains 1/5 copper and the rest is zinc, and another 5 kg of metal contains 1/6 copper and the rest is zinc. To find the ratio of copper and zinc in the mixture of these two metals, you can calculate the total amount of copper and zinc in both portions separately.

   For the first portion (4 kg of metal):

   Copper = (1/5) * 4 kg = 4/5 kg

   Zinc = 4 kg - 4/5 kg = (20/5 kg - 4/5 kg) = (16/5 kg - 4/5 kg) = (12/5 kg)

   For the second portion (5 kg of metal):

   Copper = (1/6) * 5 kg = 5/6 kg

   Zinc = 5 kg - 5/6 kg = (30/6 kg - 5/6 kg) = (25/6 kg)

   Now, find the total amount of copper and zinc in the mixture:

   Total Copper = (4/5 kg + 5/6 kg)

   Total Zinc = (12/5 kg + 25/6 kg)

   Now, find the ratio of copper to zinc:

   Ratio = (Total Copper) / (Total Zinc)

   Ratio = [(4/5 kg + 5/6 kg)] / [(12/5 kg + 25/6 kg)]

   You can find a common denominator to simplify the fractions and then calculate the ratio.

   Answer: None of these (The question asks for a specific ratio, and it needs further calculation to simplify the fractions and find the exact ratio.)

4) In what ratio must water be mixed with milk costing Rs.12 per liter to obtain a mixture worth Rs.8 per liter?

   Let the ratio be x:y, where x is the quantity of milk (Rs.12 per liter) and y is the quantity of water (Rs.0 per liter).

   According to the mixture rule:

   (12x + 0y) / (x + y) = 8

   12x = 8(x + y)

   12x = 8x + 8y

   12x - 8x = 8y

   4x = 8y

   x/y = 8/4 = 2

   So, the required ratio is 2:1, which means for every 2 parts of milk, you need to mix 1 part of water.

   Answer: a) 1:2

5) A sum of Rs.4000 is lent out in two parts, one at 8% simple interest and the other at 10% simple interest. If the annual interest is Rs.352, the sum lent at 8% is:

   Let the sum lent at 8% be Rs. x.

   The sum lent at 10% is Rs. (4000 - x) because the total sum lent is Rs. 4000.

   According to the given information:

   Interest from the 8% part + Interest from the 10% part = Total interest

   (x * 8 * 1/100) + ((4000 - x) * 10 * 1/100) = 352

   (8x/100) + (40000 - 10x)/100 = 352

   (8x + 40000 - 10x)/100 = 352

   (-2x + 40000)/100 = 352

   -2x + 40000 = 35200

   -2x = 35200 - 40000

   -2x = -4800

   x = -4800 / -2

   x = 2400

   So, the sum lent at 8% is Rs. 2400.

   Answer: b) 2400

6) A merchant has 1000 kg of sugar, part of which he sells at an 8% profit and the rest at an 18% profit. He gains 14% on the whole. The quantity sold at an 18% profit is:

   Let the quantity sold at an 8% profit be x kg.

   The quantity sold at an 18% profit is (1000 - x) kg because he has a total of 1000 kg of sugar.

   According to the given information:

   (x * 8/100) + ((1000 - x) * 18/100) = 1000 * 14/100

   (8x/100) + (18000 - 18x)/100 = 14000/100

   (8x + 18000 - 18x)/100 = 14000/100

   (-10x + 18000)/100 = 14000/100

   -10x + 18000 = 14000

   -10x = 14000 - 18000

   -10x = -4000

   x = -4000 / -10

   x = 400

   So, the quantity sold at an 18% profit is 1000 kg - 400 kg = 600 kg.

   Answer: c) 600 kg

7) How many kilograms of sugar costing Rs.9 per kg must be mixed with 27 kg of sugar costing Rs.7 per kg so that there may be a gain of 10% by selling the mixture at Rs.9.24 per kg?

   Let the required quantity of sugar costing Rs.9 per kg be x kg.

   According to the given information:

   (Total cost of x kg of sugar at Rs.9 per kg + Total cost of 27 kg of sugar at Rs.7 per kg) / (x + 27) = Rs.9.24 per kg

   (9x + 7 * 27) / (x + 27) = 9.24

   (9x + 189) / (x + 27) = 9.24

   Now, you can cross-multiply and solve for x:

   9x + 189 = 9.24(x + 27)

   9x + 189 = 9.24x

 + 250.68

   9.24x - 9x = 250.68 - 189

   0.24x = 61.68

   x = 61.68 / 0.24

   x ≈ 257 kg

   So, approximately 257 kg of sugar costing Rs.9 per kg must be mixed.

   Answer: d) 257 kg

8) A mixture of 40 liters of milk and water contains 10% water. How much water must be added to make the water 15% in the new mixture?

   Let the quantity of water to be added be x liters.

   According to the given information:

   In the initial mixture of 40 liters, there is 10% water. So, the quantity of water in the initial mixture = 10% of 40 liters = (10/100) * 40 liters = 4 liters.

   In the new mixture of (40 + x) liters, the water should be 15%. So, the quantity of water in the new mixture should be 15% of (40 + x) liters = (15/100) * (40 + x) liters = (3/20) * (40 + x) liters = (3/20) * (40 + x) liters = (3/20) * (40 + x) liters.

   Now, we want to add x liters of water to the initial mixture, so the total quantity of water in the new mixture should be 4 liters + x liters.

   According to the given condition:

   The quantity of water in the new mixture should be (4 liters + x liters), and this should be equal to (3/20) * (40 + x) liters.

   So, we have the equation:

   4 + x = (3/20) * (40 + x)

   Now, you can solve this equation to find the value of x:

   20 * (4 + x) = 3 * (40 + x)

   80 + 20x = 120 + 3x

   20x - 3x = 120 - 80

   17x = 40

   x = 40 / 17

   x ≈ 2.35 liters (approximately)

   So, approximately 2.35 liters of water must be added to make the water 15% in the new mixture.

   Answer: c) 2.35 liters

9) In a 40-liter mixture of milk and water, the ratio of milk to water is 4:1. How many liters of water must be added to the mixture to make the ratio of milk to water 5:2?

   Let the quantity of milk in the mixture be 4x liters, and the quantity of water be x liters (according to the 4:1 ratio).

   According to the given information, the total mixture is 40 liters:

   4x (milk) + x (water) = 40

   5x = 40

   x = 40 / 5

   x = 8 liters

   So, initially, there are 8 liters of water in the mixture and 32 liters of milk.

   Now, we want to make the ratio of milk to water 5:2. Let the quantity of water to be added be y liters.

   After adding y liters of water, the ratio becomes:

   (32 liters + y) / (8 liters + y) = 5/2

   Cross-multiply and solve for y:

   2 * (32 + y) = 5 * (8 + y)

   64 + 2y = 40 + 5y

   3y = 64 - 40

   3y = 24

   y = 24 / 3

   y = 8 liters

   So, 8 liters of water must be added to the mixture to make the ratio of milk to water 5:2.

   Answer: b) 8 liters

10) A milkman mixes 2 liters of water with every 3 liters of milk. How many liters of milk should be added to 30 liters of this mixture to make it a mixture of 5 liters of water for every 7 liters of milk?

    Let's denote the required quantity of milk to be added as 'x' liters.

    Currently, the ratio of water to milk in the mixture is 2:3, which means for every 2 liters of water, there are 3 liters of milk.

    The initial mixture contains 30 liters of this 2:3 mixture, which means it contains (2/5) * 30 = 12 liters of water and (3/5) * 30 = 18 liters of milk.

    Now, you want to make it a mixture of 5 liters of water for every 7 liters of milk.

    The ratio you want is 5:7, which means for every 5 liters of water, there should be 7 liters of milk.

    So, the additional water needed is 5 - 2 = 3 liters for every 5 - 3 = 2 liters of milk.

    To find the amount of milk needed to balance the ratio, you can set up a proportion:

    (3 liters of water) / (2 liters of milk) = (x liters of water) / (18 + x liters of milk)

    Cross-multiply and solve for x:

    3(18 + x) = 2x

    54 + 3x = 2x

    3x - 2x = -54

    x = -54

    Since you cannot have a negative quantity of milk, it means you don't need to add any milk to the mixture. The current mixture is already in the desired 5:7 ratio.

    Answer: d) 0 liters
