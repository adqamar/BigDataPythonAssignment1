Senior Data Engineer role)
ans1. Designing a data warehouse for the Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket tournament requires careful consideration of the data sources, storage, processing, and analysis requirements. Here's a high-level design for the data warehouse:

1. Data Sources:

Collect data from various sources such as official IPL website, live feeds, social media, match statistics, player profiles, team information, and more. Data sources may include:
- Match details (date, time, venue, teams, scores, outcomes)
- Player statistics (runs, wickets, strike rate, averages, etc.)
- Team information (rosters, captains, coaches, franchises)
- Fan engagement data (social media interactions, polls, surveys)
- Broadcast data (viewership, ad revenue)
- Weather conditions during matches

2. Data Integration:

Transform and integrate data from diverse sources into a unified format using ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes. Consider using tools like Apache Spark, Apache NiFi, or Talend for data integration.

3. Data Storage:

Store data in a structured manner that allows efficient querying and analysis. You can use a cloud-based data warehousing solution such as Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, or Snowflake. Create fact and dimension tables:
- Fact Tables: Match results, player performances, viewership data
- Dimension Tables: Teams, players, venues, time, weather

4. Data Modeling:

Implement a star schema or snowflake schema for efficient querying and analysis. This involves creating relationships between fact and dimension tables. For instance:
- Fact Table: MatchResults (match_id, date, venue_id, team1_id, team2_id, result_id, player_of_the_match_id, ...)
- Dimension Tables: Team (team_id, name, franchise, ...), Player (player_id, name, team_id, ...), Venue (venue_id, name, location, ...), Result (result_id, description, ...), Date (date_id, full_date, day_of_week, ...)

5. Data Quality and Cleansing:

Implement data quality checks and cleansing processes to ensure accurate and reliable data in the warehouse. Handle missing or inconsistent data appropriately.

6. Data Security:

Implement proper access controls and encryption mechanisms to ensure data security and compliance with privacy regulations.
7. Query Performance Optimization:

Optimize query performance by creating indexes, materialized views, and using partitioning strategies. This ensures that analytical queries run efficiently, even on large datasets.
SQL Queries for Business Metrics:**

1. **Total Matches Played by Each Team:**
```sql
SELECT t.name AS team_name, COUNT(*) AS total_matches_played
FROM Team t
JOIN MatchResults m ON t.team_id = m.team1_id OR t.team_id = m.team2_id
GROUP BY t.name;
```

2. **Top Players by Total Runs:**
```sql
SELECT p.name AS player_name, t.name AS team_name, SUM(mr.runs) AS total_runs
FROM Player p
JOIN MatchResults mr ON p.player_id = mr.player_id
JOIN Team t ON p.team_id = t.team_id
GROUP BY p.name, t.name
ORDER BY total_runs DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

3. **Average Run Rate by Team:**
```sql
SELECT t.name AS team_name, AVG(mr.runs / (mr.balls / 6.0)) AS avg_run_rate
FROM Team t
JOIN MatchResults mr ON t.team_id = mr.team1_id OR t.team_id = mr.team2_id
GROUP BY t.name;
```

4. **Venue-wise Match Count:**
```sql
SELECT v.name AS venue_name, COUNT(*) AS match_count
FROM Venue v
JOIN MatchResults mr ON v.venue_id = mr.venue_id
GROUP BY v.name;
```

5. **Matches with High Individual Scores:**
```sql
SELECT m.match_id, p.name AS player_name, m.runs AS runs_scored
FROM MatchResults m
JOIN Player p ON m.player_of_the_match_id = p.player_id
WHERE m.runs > 100
ORDER BY m.runs DESC;
```

These SQL queries showcase how the data in the designed Data Warehouse can be utilized to generate insightful business metrics for the IPL Cricket Tournament.

8. Analytics and Reporting:

Enable users to perform advanced analytics and generate insightful reports. You can use business intelligence tools like Tableau, Power BI, or Looker for creating dashboards and visualizations.

9. Real-time Analytics:

Consider implementing a real-time analytics layer for live match statistics and updates. Use technologies like Apache Kafka or Apache Flink to process and display real-time data.

10. Scalability and Monitoring:

Design the data warehouse with scalability in mind, as IPL data can grow significantly over time. Implement monitoring and alerting to track system performance and resource utilization.

Remember, this is a high-level overview, and the specific design may vary based on your infrastructure, technologies, and business requirements. The design should address data collection, integration, storage, modeling, security, performance, and analytical needs of the IPL cricket tournament data.
